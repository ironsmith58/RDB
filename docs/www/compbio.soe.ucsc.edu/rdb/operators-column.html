<H2>column</H2>
Usage: <CODE>column  [options]  list</CODE>

<P>
     Selects columns by name (and order) and outputs an rdbtable with
these columns.  Can effectively select, order, add, delete, or duplicate
columns.

<P>
     The value 'list' is normally a list of column names.  If 'list'
contains a triplicate of the form '-c NAME NEW' then column name 'NAME'
will be changed to 'NEW'.  If 'list' contains a triplicate of the form
'-a  NAME  DEFN' then a new (null) column is added, at that point in the
list of column names, with name 'NAME' and definition 'DEFN'.

<P>
     This RDB operator reads an rdbtable from STDIN and writes an
rdbtable to STDOUT.  Options may be abbreviated.

<P>
Options:
<UL>
<LI> -edit - Edit option. Used by etbl.

<LI> -help - Print this help information.

<LI> -v - Inverse option. Selects all columns except those named.
</UL>

<P>
     As an example using the sample rdbtable from the DATA section
(named sample), to select columns named 'NAME' and 'COUNT' the command
would be:

<PRE>
        column  NAME  COUNT  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

To select all columns except column 'NAME' the command would be:

<PRE>
        column  -v  NAME  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

To add a new column named 'LENGTH' with a size of 10 the command would
be:
<PRE>
        column  -v  -a  LENGTH  10  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

Note that to include documentation with the new column definition the
command would be:
<PRE>
        column  -v  -a  LENGTH  '10 length in meters'  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

The '10 length in meters' must be quoted so that it will be treated  as
a single token.
