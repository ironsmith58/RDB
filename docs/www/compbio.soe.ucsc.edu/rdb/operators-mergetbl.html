<H2>mergetbl</H2>
Usage: <CODE>mergetbl  [options]  &lt; old_table  column  ...  merge_table</CODE>

<P>
     This operator merges and/or deletes rows of 'old_table' based on
data values in 'merge_table' in the specified column(s).  Both tables
should be sorted on the specified column(s).

<P>
     In the normal case, one or more rows in 'merge_table' either
replace one or more existing rows in 'old_table' if the key column(s)
match, or are inserted in order if the key column(s) do NOT match.

<P>
     If the delete option is specified on the command line, one or more
existing rows in 'old_table' will be deleted if there is a key column(s)
match and the data in the delete column is equal to the delete string,
"&gt;&gt;DEL&lt;&lt;" (without the quotes) by default.  The delete column is the
first non-key column in 'merge_table'.

<P>
     Both tables should have similar data structures. The header for the
new rdbtable is taken from 'merge_table', thus allowing a change of
header  information to be made.

<P>
Options:
<UL>
<LI> -d - Delete option. Delete rows where the key column(s) match and
             the data value in the delete column is equal to the delete
             string, "&gt;&gt;DEL&lt;&lt;" (without the quotes) by default.

<LI> -dSTG - Like the delete option above but use 'STG' as the delete string.

<LI> -help - Print this help info.
</UL>

<P>
     This operator writes an rdbtable via STDOUT.  Options may be
abbreviated.
