<P>
     This working draft describes, and provides instructions for the use
of, the RDB system as it currently exists at RAND.  The RDB system is
currently used by a number of projects at RAND, however the development
is not finished and there are plans to make enhancements and extensions
as required.  Accordingly, revisions of this document will be produced.

<P>
     The preparation of this research document was sponsored through
RAND's three federally funded research and development centers - the
National Defense Research Institute (sponsored by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff), the Arroyo Center (sponsored
by the U.S. Army), and Project AIR FORCE (sponsored by the U.S. Air
Force).

<P>
     It should be noted that the development of the computer code
comprising the RDB system was not done under any RAND contract and was
accomplished on non-RAND time as a personal computer science project of
the author.
