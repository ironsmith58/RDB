Usage: <CODE>search  [options]  rdbtbl  &lt;  keytbl</CODE>

<P>
     This operator does a fast search of 'rdbtbl' using a binary search
on a key of of one or more columns.  The 'rdbtbl' must be sorted on the
key columns.  Each column in the key may be of type string or type
numeric (but be careful with numeric data and exact matches).

<P>
     The column(s) in 'keytbl' specify both the key column name(s) and
the argument values to search for. 'Keytbl' is also in rdbtable format.

<P>
     Normally an argument value and a data field must compare exactally
for a match  to occur (exact match). If the paritial match otpion
(-part) is selected, and if the argument value compares with the initial
part of the data field it is considered a match. This applies to string
type data only. Note that for numeric type data an exact match is always
necessary.

<P>
     Normally all rows that match will be written to the new rdbtable,
in the  same order as in the old rdbtable. If only a single row key
match is appropriate some execution time can be saved by specifing the
'-sgl' option.

<P>
Options:
<UL>

<LI> -help - Print this help info.

<P>
     This operator writes an rdbtable via STDOUT.  Options may be
abbreviated.
