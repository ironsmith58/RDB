<H2>compute</H2>
Usage: <CODE>compute  [options]  [statements]</CODE>
<P>
     Computes values for data fields based on arbitrary statements using
column names. Any characters that are special to the UNIX shell must be
quoted.

<P>
     Comparison operators may be of the form: gt, ge, lt, le, eq, ne.
For example 'NAME  eq  Hobbs'.  Logical constructors 'or' and 'and' may
be used; as well as 'null' to indicate an empty data value.  The
supplied statements may be essentially any valid PERL statements.

<P>
     All of the Comparison operators and Logical constructors are
reserved and should not be used as column names (they are all lower case
and four characters or less).

<P>
<P>
Options:
<UL>
<LI> -help - Print this help information.

<LI> -fXXX - The statements are in the file 'XXX', instead of on the
             command line. The advantage in this case is that no quoting
             of characters that might be special to the UNIX shell is
             necessary.
</UL>

<P>
     This operator reads a rdbtable via STDIN and writes a rdbtable via
STDOUT.  Options may be abbreviated.

<P>
     If a file is used to contain the statements any line in the file
that starts with a sharp sign (#) is treated as a comment and ignored.
Also if there is a sharp sign preceded by a space character anywhere on
the line the rest of the line is also treated as a comment.

<P>
     Since column names and reserved words are parsed by the program, do
not put the entire expression in a single pair of quotes as that will
prevent the parsing.  Also note that column names and reserved words
need to be surrounded by blank spaces if they are not individually
quoted.  For example either form below is fine:

<PRE>
        row   NAME    eq   "L Brown"  &lt;  sample

        row  "NAME"  "eq"  "L Brown"  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

but do not use this form:

<PRE>
        row  "NAME  eq  L Brown"  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

Example rdbtable (named cfile):

<PRE>
        name    count   type    amt
        6       5N      4       5N
        Bush    3       A       133
        Hansen  39      A       23
        Newton  8       E       8
        Hobbs   42      B       144
        Hart    2       C       55
        Jones   4       B       244
        Smith   5       D       1111
</PRE>

The command:
<PRE>
        compute  count  +=  100  if  type  lt  D  &lt;  cfile  |  ptbl
</PRE>

gives the output:

<PRE>
        name    count  type    amt
        ------  -----  ----  -----
        Bush      103  A       133
        Hansen    139  A        23
        Newton      8  E         8
        Hobbs     142  B       144
        Hart      102  C        55
        Jones     104  B       244
        Smith       5  D      1111
</PRE>

Example file of commands named 'XXX':

<PRE>
        if( type eq A ){
            name = NEW ;
            amt = count * 2 ;
            type = 'AAA' ;
        }
        else{
            name = OLD ;
            amt = count + 1000 ;
            type = 'ZZZ' ;
        }
</PRE>

Output from command:

<PRE>
        compute  -fXXX  &lt;  cfile  |  ptbl
</PRE>

would be:

<PRE>
        name    count  type    amt
        ------  -----  ----  -----
        NEW         3  AAA       6
        NEW        39  AAA      78
        OLD         8  ZZZ    1008
        OLD        42  ZZZ    1042
        OLD         2  ZZZ    1002
        OLD         4  ZZZ    1004
        OLD         5  ZZZ    1005
</PRE>
