<H1>Data Access Control</H1>

<H2>GENERAL</H2>

<P>
     Since rdbtables are regular UNIX files, we have so far found no
need to implement, and have the associated overhead of, general data
access controls in RDB.  Setting the UNIX permissions on files or
directory  has proven very useful and effective.  This is another
example of how the RDB system works "with" UNIX, not in addition to it,
e.g. not duplicating UNIX functions.

<P>
     The Revision Control System (RCS) is one of the best configuration
management tools available and is in use here at RAND for version
control of many types of files, including rdbtables.  The operator
'etbl' will automatically check out an rdbtable for editing, and then
check the new version back into RCS.  Other operators can utilize
rdbtables that are under RCS control by using commands like:

<PRE>
        co  -p  table  |  row  ...  |  column  ...  |  ptbl
</PRE>

<P>
     Note that this checks out an rdbtable, sends it to 'row', then to
'column', and finally prints the data with 'ptbl'.  In general, any
series of commands necessary can be constructed to do a given task even
if the rdbtables are checked into RCS.

<H2>WRITE CONCURRENCY CONTROL</H2>

<P>
     When either of the two utility operators 'etbl' or 'dataent' is
used  (which modify an rdbtable in place) there could be a possibility
of silmultaneous wrting  of an rdbtable by multiple users. That is, if
two or more users, on the same computer or perhaps on different
computers on a network, attempted to modify a given rdbtable with either
'etbl' or 'dataent' at the same time the rdbtable could become
corrupted.  To prevent this, write concurrency control is provided by
the use of a lockfile, and is in effect when either of the two utility
operators is used.

<P>
     The name of the lockfile is the name of the rdbtable being modified
with a suffix of ".LCK". For example an rdbtable named "main.rdb"  would
have a lockfile named "main.rdb.LCK".  The lockfile is placed in the
same directory as the rdbtable and  is normally removed after the
modification process is complete, even if the operation is aborted with
an INTERRUPT signal (CONTROL-C or &lt;DEL&gt;).  However in the event of an
emergency such as a computer system crash the lockfile could be left in
place, preventing the use of 'etbl' or 'dataent' when the computer
system is again operable.  When an attempt to use either utility
operator is made an there is and existing lockfile associated with the
referenced rdbtable an online message is produced and the operator dies.
In this case simply remove the lockfile with the UNIX command 'rm' and
proceed.  If an emergency has not occurred appropriate caution should be
exercised before removing a lockfile, due to the possibility of data
corruption.
