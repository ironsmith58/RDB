<H1>Data (rdbtable)</H1>
<P>
     The data is contained in regular UNIX, ASCII files and therefore
can be manipulated by regular UNIX utilities, e.g. grep, ls, wc, mv, cp,
cat, more, less, head, RCS, and editors like the RAND editor 'e', vi,
etc.  A good way to view the data of course, would be to use the RDB
operator that prints such datafiles 'ptbl'.

<P>
     The relation, or table structure is achieved by separating the
columns  with ASCII TAB characters, and terminating the rows with ASCII
NEWLINE characters.  That is, each row of data in a file contains the
data values (a data field) separated by TAB characters and terminated
with a NEWLINE character.  Therefore a fundamental rule is that data
values must NOT contain TAB characters.

<P>
     The first section of the file, called the header, contains the file
structure information used by the operators.  The header also contains
optional embedded documentation relating to the entire datafile (table
documentation) and/or each data column (column documentation).  The rest
of the file, called the body, contains the actual data values.  A file
of data, so structured, is said to be an 'rdbtable'.

<P>
     The header consists of two or more lines.  There is an optional
number (zero or more) of lines of table documentation followed by
exactally two lines that contain the structure information: the column
name row and the column definition row.  The table documentation lines
start with either a sharp sign (#) followed by a space character, or one
or more space characters followed by a sharp sign (#).  The rest of each
line may contain any documentation desired.  Note that the table
documentation lines are the only lines in an rdbtable that are not
required to conform to the table structure defined above.  The fields in
the column name row contain the names of each column.  The fields in the
column definition row contain the data definitions and optional column
documentation for each column.

<P>
     The column names are case sensitive, i.e. 'COUNT' is different from
'Count'.  The guideline for characters that may be used in column names
is that alphabetic, numeric, and non-alphanumeric characters that are
not special to the UNIX shell are good choices.  Column names must
include at least one alphabetic character.  It is highly recommended
(but not required) that column names start with an alphabetic or numeric
character.

<P>
     Non-alphanumeric characters that are acceptable in column names are
the percent sign (%) colon (:) at sign (@) equals (=) comma (,) and dot
(.).  The sharp sign (#) underscore (_) and dash (-) characters may also
be used but they must not be the first character in a column name.  The
TAB character must never be used in column names, nor should internal
spaces or UNIX I/O redirection characters (&lt;,&gt;,|) be used.

<P>
     The data definitions include column width, data type, and
justification.  The column width must be explicitly specified; the
others are optional  and are frequently specified by default.

<P>
     The data definitions are specified by adjacent characters in a
single word.  The width of each field is specified by a numeric count.
The type of data is "string", "numeric", or "month".  The types are
specified by an 'S', 'N', or 'M' respectively, and the default is type
string.  Printout justification is 'left', or 'right', and is specified
by an '&lt;' or '&gt;' character respectively.  If not specified,
data types
string and month will be left justified and type numeric will be right
justified.

<P>
     Note that column width is used primarily by the operator 'ptbl' and
in no way limits the actual data size.  It is not an error if some
actual data in a column is wider than the defined width; a listing
produced with 'ptbl' may be  out of alignment however.

<P>
     The optional documentation for each column follows the data
definition word in the field.  There must be one or more space
characters after the data definition word and before the column
documentation; the column documentation may be as long as necessary.
Note that the data definition and the optional column documentation  are
contained in a single field in the row.

<P>
     If the column name and/or column definition rows contain much
information and/or column documentation they can become long and
confusing to read. However the  operators 'valid' and 'headchg' have
options to print the header contents as a 'template' file, an organized
list of information about the header.

<P>
     A sample rdbtable (named sample) that will be used in  later
examples is shown in Table 1.  The picture in Table 1 is for
illustrative purposes; what the file would actually look like is shown
in Table 2, where a TAB character is represented by '&lt;T&gt;'
and a NEWLINE character is represented by '&lt;N&gt;'.

<P>
     It is important to note that only actual data is stored in the data
fields, with no leading or trailing space characters. This fact can
(and usually does) have a major effect on the size of the resulting
datafiles (rdbtables) compared to data stored in "fixed field width"
systems.  The datafiles in RDB are almost always smaller, sometimes
dramatically smaller.
