<H2>uniqtbl</H2>
Usage: <CODE>uniqtbl  [options]  column  ...</CODE>

<P>
     Reads the input rdbtable and compares adjacent rows. The second and
succeeding copies of repeated rows, considering only the selected
columns, are removed.  That is, adjacent rows are considered equal if
the data values in all of the selected columns are equal.  The remaining
rows are written to the output rdbtable.

<P>
     Note that repeated rows must be adjacent in order to be found.
Normally this means that the input rdbtable should be sorted on the
selected columns for this capability to work properly.

<P>
Options:
<UL>

<LI> -D -Diagnostic output. Prints number of rows removed on STDERR.

<LI> -help - Print this help info.

<LI> -v - Inverse option. Selects all columns except those named.
</UL>

<P>
     This RDB operator reads an rdbtable from STDIN and writes an
rdbtable to STDOUT.  Options may be abbreviated.
