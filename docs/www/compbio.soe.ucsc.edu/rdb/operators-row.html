Usage: <CODE>row  [options]  expression</CODE>
<P>
Options:
<UL>

<LI> -help - Print this help information.

<LI> -fXXX - The expression is in the file 'XXX', instead of on the
             command line. The advantage in this case is that no quoting
             of chars that might be special to the UNIX shell is necessary.
</UL>

<P>
     Selects rows from the input rdbtable based on an arbitrary
expression using column names.  Characters that are special to the UNIX
shell must be quoted.

<P>
     Logical constructors 'or' and 'and' may be used; as well as 'null'
to indicate empty data values.  Comparison operators may be of the form:
gt, ge, lt, le, eq, ne, mat, nmat.  The first six are the usual
operators, E.g 'name eq Hobbs' or 'COUNT gt 100'.  The last two stand
for 'match' and 'non-match' and are used for pattern matching. They are
exactally the same as using the PERL operators '=~' or '!~'
respectively, except that pattern matching can be specified easier in
expressions, as in:

<PRE>
        NAME  mat   /[Hh]obbs/ 		&lt;&lt;&lt; First letter either case
        NAME  mat   /hobbs/i		&lt;&lt;&lt; any combination of case
        NAME  nmat  /[aeiou]/i		&lt;&lt;&lt; names without vowels
</PRE>

where 'NAME' and 'COUNT' are column names, of course.  A warning message
is produced on STDERR if either of 'mat' or 'nmat' is used with a
numeric type column, but the execution continues.  It does not check the
'=~' or '!~' forms.

<P>
     All of the Comparison operators and Logical constructors are
reserved and should not be used as column names (they are all lower case
and four characters or less).

<P>
     Since column names and reserved words are parsed by the program, do
not put the entire expression in a single pair of quotes as that will
prevent the parsing.  Also note that column names and reserved words
need to be surrounded by blank spaces if they are not individually
quoted.  For example either form below is fine:

<PRE>
        row   NAME    eq   "L Brown"  &lt;  sample
        row  "NAME"  "eq"  "L Brown"  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

but do not use this form:

<PRE>
        row  "NAME  eq  L Brown"  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

<P>
     This operator reads an rdbtable via STDIN and writes an rdbtable
via STDOUT.  Options may be abbreviated.

<P>
     As an example using the sample rdbtable from the DATA section
(named sample), to select rows that have the NAME column equal to
'Hansen'  the command would be:

<PRE>
        row  NAME  eq  Hansen  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

which would produce:

<PRE>
        NAME    COUNT   TYP     AMT     OTHER   RIGHT
        6       5N      4       5N      8       8&gt;
        Hansen  44      A       23      One     Is
</PRE>

to select rows that have the TYP column equal to 'A' or that have the
AMT column greater than 1000 the command would be:

<PRE>
        row  TYP  eq  A  or  AMT  gt  1000  &lt;  sample
</PRE>

producing:

<PRE>
        NAME    COUNT   TYP     AMT     OTHER   RIGHT
        6       5N      4       5N      8       8&gt;
        Bush    44      A       133     Another This
        Hansen  44      A       23      One     Is
        Hart    77      D       1111    So      Right
        Holmes  65      D       1111    On      Edge
</PRE>

<P>
     Note that in some rare cases there could be a column name that is
identical to a data value specified in an expression using another
column name that might cause a problem (this actually happened).  For
example if two column names are 'N' and 'T', and column 'N' has a data
value of 'T', to select all rows where column 'N' is equal to 'T' the
normal command would be:

<PRE>
    row  &lt;  table  N  eq  T
</PRE>

Unfortunately the 'T' in the expression gets translated to 'column name
T', not used as 'data value T'. That is, the expression askes for all
rows where the data value of column N equals the data value of column T,
legal, but not what was wanted.  There is a simple workaround however.
The 'T' in the expression can be escaped with a backslash to prevent the
translation to a column name, as in the revised command:

<PRE>
    row  &lt;  table  N  eq  '\T'
</PRE>

Thus either meaning can be specified, as desired.
