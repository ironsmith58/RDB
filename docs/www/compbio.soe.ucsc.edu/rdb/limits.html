<H1>Limits, A Few Minor Ones</H1>

The following limits apply.

<UL>
<LI> There must not be any ASCII TAB characters in the data.  This
         is the primary limit as the ASCII TAB character is the
         delimiter in rdbtables.

<LI> There must not be any pipe characters `|` used or entered as
         data when using the operator 'etbl'.

<LI> All of the Compare operators and Logical constructors are
         reserved and should not be used as column names (they are all
         lower case and four characters or less).  They are: 'gt', 'ge',
         'lt', 'le', 'eq', 'ne', 'or', 'and', 'null', 'mat', and 'nmat'.
</UL>
