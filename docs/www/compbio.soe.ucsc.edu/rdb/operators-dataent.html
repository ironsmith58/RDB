<H2>DATAENT</H2>
Usage: <CODE>dataent  [options]  rdbtable</CODE> <BR>
   or: <CODE>dataent  [options]  -init  template</CODE>

<P>
     This utility provides an interactive capability for entering data
into an rdbtable. The user is prompted by column name for data values.
Options may be abbreviated.

<P>
Options:
<UL>
<LI> -help - Print this help info.

<LI> -init - Initiate a new rdbtable.

<LI> -nbr - Do NOT remove leading and trailing blank space from data values.

<LI> -prev - Use data values from previous row as defaults for current row.
</UL>

<P>
     In the first case of usage above, new rows of data are added at the
end of an existing rdbtable. In the second case, a template file is used
to generate a new rdbtable and add rows of data to it.

<P>
     At each column name prompt the user may enter data followed by a
&lt;RET&gt; or just a &lt;RET&gt; to retain the current value, which is
initially null.  Normally leading and trailing blank space is removed from data
values.  If it is desired to prevent this enter a backslash (\) as the
first character (the backslash will be removed) or use the '-nbr'
option.  In order to replace an existing data value with a null value
enter a backslash (\) and a &lt;RET&gt;.

<P>
     At any column name prompt, if a single space character is entered,
followed by a &lt;RET&gt;, control is transferred to the end of row action
prompt.  This is useful if not all data values need to be entered on all
rows.  If two space characters followed by a &lt;RET&gt; is entered control is
transferred to the previous column name prompt.  This is useful if an
error was made entering data; it can be corrected immediately.

<P>
     After all the column name prompts for a row have been responded to,
the user is asked for the next action. The default is to save the
current row of data to the rdbtable and go on to enter data for the next
row. Other options available are to go back and check each value of the
current row; to quit, saving or not saving the current row; to list the
data values for the entire row; to delete the current row and start a
new one; to jump back to a specified column name prompt for the current
row and continue from there; or to produce a help listing.  Also the
setting of the '-nbr' and '-prev' options may be toggled on or off.

<P>
     At any time an INTERRUPT signal (^C or DEL) may be entered to abort
the program.  In this case all rows of data except the current one will
be saved.

<P>
     Uses RDB operator: headchg.
