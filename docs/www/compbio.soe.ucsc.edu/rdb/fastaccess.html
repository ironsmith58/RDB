<H1>Fast Access Methods</H1>

<P>
     The RDB operator 'search' may be used to execute one of two fast
access methods (binary or hashtable search,  although currently only
binary search is implemented).

<P>
     These methods are useful when the key field values of a number of
rows in an existing, large rdbtable is known in advance, a common
situation.

<P>
     One example of updating an rdbtable using these methods is as
follows.  First, 'search' is used to quickly obtain a new, small
rdbtable consisting of the desired rows from the existing, large
rdbtable.  Then 'etbl' is used to update the data in the new rdbtable,
including generating new rows, changing some rows, and marking certain
rows for deletion, if desired.  The next stage would be to use
'mergetbl' to combine the new and old rdbtables into a new, large
rdbtable, which will still be in sort order (both the old rdbtable and
the new, small one will still exist for backup and/or journaling
purposes).  Note that the last step could be done in the background.
