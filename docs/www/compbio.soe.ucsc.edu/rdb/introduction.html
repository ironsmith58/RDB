<P>
     A good question one could ask is "With all the relational database
management systems available today, why do we need another one?" There
are five reasons. They are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>     RDB is easy to use by non-computer people. The concept is
         straight forward and logical. To select rows of data, the 'row'
         operator is used; to select columns of data, the 'column'
         operator is used.
<LI>     The data is highly portable to and from other types of
         machines, like Macintoshes or MSDOS computers.
<LI>     The system will run on any UNIX machine (that has the PERL
         Programming Language).
<LI>     The system can work on intermediate data, which will later be
         put into a commercial RDBMS, like INGRES.
<LI>     RDB essentially has no arbitrary limits, and can work where
         INGRES can't.  For example there is no limit on data field
         size, the number of columns, or file size.
</UL>

<P>
     A more through discussion of why this type of relational database
structure makes sense is found in the book, "UNIX Relational Database
Management", Reference #2.

<P>
     It is assumed that the reader has at least a minimum knowledge of
the UNIX Operating System, including knowledge of Input/Outout
redirection (e.g., STDIN, STDOUT, pipes).

<P>
     The RDB system was implemented in the PERL programming language on
a  SUN Sparc I computer.

<P>
     This document presents information in the following order: The DATA
section describes the structure of the data, with examples.  There is a
general discussion about operators in the section on OPERATORS, followed
by several sub-sections, one for each operator in alphabetic order.
Each has detailed instructions for use, and examples.  There are
sections describing selection of information using multiple operators,
producing reports, and generating new rdbtables (data files in RDB
format).
