Usage: <CODE>etbl  [options]  rdbtable  [col_spec]  [line_spec]  [pat_spec]</CODE>

<P>
     This utility calls an editor to allow the editing of selected lines
and/or columns of (or the entire) rdbtable.  Options may be abbreviated.

<P>
Options:
<UL>

<LI> -eNAME - Use the editor 'NAME'.

<LI> -help - Print this help info.

<LI> -l[N] - Use "list" format for editing instead of "column" format. If
             N is given it is the line length to use (min is 50).

<LI> -npp - No postprocessing after return from the editor. The edited file
            is saved with a name of the form "etbl.t.nnnn" where "nnnn" is
            the process number.

<LI> -RCS - Force checkout of the rdbtable from RCS.
</UL>


    A "col_spec" is a list of column names.
<P>
    A "line_spec" is a list of line numbers, of increasing value, optionally
    separated by a dash to specify a range, e.g. "10-20". The form "N-" means
    from line N to end of file. The header is always included, so do not
    specify lines 1 or 2 (except as the first part of a larger group, e.g.
    "1-10").
 <P>
    A "pat_spec" is a single pattern (of the form: /pat/ ) optionally followed
    by one or more column names, and may be preceded with the reserved word
    'ne' to negate the meaning (e.g. the pattern should NOT match).
<P>
    The order of "Col_spec", "line_spec", and "pat_spec" is significant only
    to the extent that "col_spec" must precede "pat_spec" in the command line
    if both are given.
<P>
     If none of "col_spec", "line_spec", or "pat_spec" are given then
the entire rdbtable will be edited. If one or more of the three above
options are given then the selected subset of the rdbtable will be
edited. The option "col_spec" identifies which columns of the rdbtable
are to be edited, and options "line_spec" and "pat_spec" determine which
lines will be selected for editing, either by direct reference
("line_spec" given "col_spec" not given) or by pattern matching
("col_spec" given "line_spec" not given).  If both "line_spec" and
"pat_spec" are given then only lines within the bounds of "line_spec"
will be considered for selection by pattern matching.

<P>
     If "pat_spec" does not include column names then the pattern (any
PERL regular expression) is matched against each entire row; a row is
selected if there is a match anywhere in the row.  If column names are
included the pattern is matched against only the specified columns.  In
this case a row is selected if a match is found in any specified column.
If the "ne" option precedes the "pat_spec" without column names then an
entire row is selected if the pattern does not match anywhere in the
row, and if column names are given then the row is selected if the
pattern does not match in any specified column.

<P>
     The form of the file to be edited is either "column" with visible
column delimiters (the default) or "list" format where the column names
are on the left and the data is on the right.  The default editor is
specified by the environment variable EDITOR if set, otherwise the
editor 'e' is used.

<P>
     In either form of editing the delimiter is a "pipe" symbol (|).
Care should be taken when editing not to use any "pipe" symbols in the
data, or to delete any existing pipe symbols in the file. Also, in the
case of "list" form, one or more blank lines must separate each record.

<P>
     The rbdtable may be an existing file, or it may be automatically
checked out from RCS.  In the latter case it will be checked back into
RCS after the editing is complete.

<P>
     The default action is that if the rdbtable does not exist an
attempt will be made to find the rdbtable under RCS (the '-RCS' option
may be used to force the use of an RCS file).

<P>
     Afterward, except in the RCS case, the original contents of the
rdbtable will be left in a file of the same name preceded with a comma,
e.g.  "sample" will be ",sample".

<P>
     Uses RDB operators: column, ptbl, mktbl, tbl2lst, lst2tbl.
<P>
     WARNING: If line_spec is given the number of columns must not be
changed by editing, or if col_spec and/or "pat_spec" is given the number
of lines must not be changed by editing, otherwise the results may be
unpredictable.

<P>
     An example command to edit the rdbtable (named sample) from the
DATA section would be:

<PRE>
        etbl  sample
</PRE>

which would edit the entire rdbtable. The file as it is ready to edit is
shown in Table 3.  The pipe character '|' must not be removed during the
editing process, although it may be moved left or right if necessary and
the spaces around the pipe character may be deleted if desired.

<P>
     This form of editing is fine if the rdbtable is not large.  If it
is large then editing only those parts that need changes is faster and
less error prone. To edit only columns 'NAME', 'COUNT', and 'AMT', the
command would be:

<PRE>
        etbl  sample  NAME  COUNT  AMT
</PRE>

To edit only lines five thru seven the command would be:

<PRE>
        etbl  sample  5-7
</PRE>

To edit only lines five thru seven of only columns 'NAME', 'COUNT', and
'AMT' the command would be:

<PRE>
        etbl  sample  NAME  COUNT  AMT  5-7
</PRE>

and the file to edit would look like:

<PRE>
                                Table 3

</PRE>

Note that whenever a line_spec is given, control lines (starting with
'..&gt;&gt;&gt;' are inserted into the file to edit. They must not be modified
during the editing process.  They are used to reconstruct the rdbtable
after editing.

<P>
     If the rdbtable has data fields that are long, i.e. longer than
convenient to edit in the column form shown above, the 'list' form is
the preferred method. The usage of line_spec and col_spec are unchanged
but the form of the file to edit is different. For example consider an
rdbtable (named sample3) which is shown in Table 4, where the TAB

characters are represented by '&lt;T&gt;' and the newline characters are
represented by &lt;R&gt;. This small rdbtable looks very incoherent in raw
form, and a file of any real size with long data fields is even  more
so.  The command to edit the file sample3 in 'list' form would be:

<PRE>
        etbl  -list  sample3
</PRE>

which would produce a file to edit as shown in Table 5.  Note that each
section holds information relating to one row in the rdbtable and that
the first section holds information relating to the header of the
rdbtable.  Also note that each section is separated by a blank line (it
could be any number of blank lines).

<P>
     Each row in a section relates to a single data value.  The pipe
character '|' must not be removed during the editing process, although
it may be moved left or right if necessary. Only one pipe character is
to be in the information relating to one data value, although that
information may be physically on more than one line in the section if
the data value is long.

<P>
     The spaces on both sides of the pipe character as well as the
spaces around the column names are only for readability; they may be
moved or even deleted if desired.

<P>
     The advantage of this form of edit file is that even with very
large data values most, if not all, of the information from each row of
an rdbtable will be visible on the screen at once.
