<H2>repair</H2>
Usage: <CODE>repair  [options]  file  ...</CODE>

<P>
     Attempts to repair candidate RDB datafiles, e.g. files that have
been ported from a MacIntosh or PC (MSDOS computer) in spreadsheet form
but that do not yet have valid rdbtable structure.  Generates definition
lines (second line of header). The width of all data values is checked
and the maximum width for a column is used as the column width in the
definition line for that Table.

<P>
     It also works with existing rdbtables ('-exist' option) and is
convenient for removing leading and trailing space characters from data
values (-blank option).

<P>
     Adds fields as necessary to rows (null), or to header (DUM1, DUM2,
...) to make the Table structure valid.

<P>
     The new rdbtables will be in the current directory (even if the
input files are not) and will have the suffix changed (or added) to
'.rdb' by default.

<P>
     Options may be abbreviated.
<P>
Options:
<UL>

<LI> -blank - Remove leading and trailing blank characters from data fields.

<LI> -dN - Deletes the first N lines of each input file.  Used to
             remove extra lines before the actual header.

<LI> -exist - The file(s) are existing rdbtables. Instead of generating
             new definition lines the current ones are used as starting
             values.

<LI> -Exist - Just like '-exist' except the data width check is not done.

<LI> -help - Print this help information.

<LI> -kWORD - The first line of each input file containing "WORD" will
             be considered the line containing the column names  Works
             after the '-d' option, if given.

<LI> -rFILE - Use the template file 'FILE' to replace the existing header.

<LI> -sXXX - Suffix on new files of 'XXX' instead of '.rdb'.

<LI> -tFILE - Use the template file 'FILE' for header and definition data
             instead of scaning the input files.
</UL>
