Format and print the man-page 'cterm.1'.
Follow the instructions in the section on 'Installation'.

Note that on a Sun you will probably want to use the SYSV C compiler
(/usr/5bin/cc) because it provides a better Curses.
Set the CC-variable in the Makefile to '/usr/5bin/cc',
and the LDFLAGS to '-lcurses -ltermcap'.
When using the standard cc-compiler, I could compile everything properly
but bsd-curses messed up my screen.

On Ultrix ATT-curses is available in 'cursesX' (instead of 'curses').
What I did was modify all references to 'curses' in *.mk, *.c and *.h to
'cursesX'.  I set CFLAGS to '-YPOSIX -DLANGUAGE_C' (note the '-Y')
and LDFLAGS to '-lcursesX'. It worked.

On a Convex, cbreak (nocbreak) are called crmode (nocrmode).
Add the definitions 'cbreak(){crmode();}' and 'nocbreak(){nocrmode();}' 
to 'cursesXt.c' for compatibility.

History:
1. Posting on Usenet in comp.lang.perl (date ??).
2. Before posting Jinx on Usenet one bug regarding the setting of
   the loglevel was removed.
3. After posting Jinx, problems with arrow keys showed up. Functionality
   was added to control the key-left and key-right commands of the
   built-in editor. Also 'cursesX' was renamed to 'cursesXt' because
   of a name clash with Ultrix's X/open version of 'curses'.

Please mail me (henkp@cs.ruu.nl) about problems encountered during
installation on other systems.
