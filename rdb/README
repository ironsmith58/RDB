			    Documentation

The documentation is the (postscript) file 'RDB.ps'. This is about
60 pages when printed on a postscript printer.  The file 'rdb'
contains a quick overview of this RDB system, also, each of the RDB
operators takes a '-help' option for online information.  There is
information on the RDB system in the magazine article referenced
below and in the book referenced in the documentation file.

			    Disclamer

This program (the set of RDB operators) is still in the process of
development.  It is not guaranteed to be error free; however it
works very well for our current efforts and I know of no outstanding
errors.  Use as desired; if errors or unusual conditions are found
please let me know.  Feedback is encouraged. I will make modifications
and distribute updated versions.

The development of this program was NOT done under any Government
contract or Government sponsored effort.

Note that this program was implemented ENTIRELY from the
information contained in the article in "Unix Review", March,
1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language" and our own expansion on
those ideas.  No other outside source of information on RDB was
known or used at the time.
